## System Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend (Next.js/React)
    ↓ API Requests
Backend (Django REST Framework)
    ↓ Authentication (JWT)
Subscription Middleware
    ↓ Access Control
dj-stripe (Stripe Integration)
    ↓ Webhook Processing
Stripe API (Payment Processing)
```

### Key Components

**1. dj-stripe Integration**
- Automatically syncs Stripe data to Django database
- Provides Django models for Stripe objects
- Handles webhook signature verification
- Manages subscription lifecycle

**2. Custom Subscription Services**
- `/backend/apps/subscriptions/services.py`
- Customer creation and linking
- Trial eligibility logic
- Subscription management
- Customer Portal session creation

**3. Webhook Signal Handlers**
- `/backend/apps/subscriptions/signals.py`
- Process Stripe webhook events
- Track trial usage
- Handle subscription state changes
- Log payment events

**4. Subscription Middleware**
- `/backend/apps/subscriptions/middleware.py`
- Enforce subscription-based access control
- Block non-subscribed users from protected endpoints
- Handle expired/canceled subscriptions
- Manage trial eligibility

**5. API Endpoints**
- `/api/subscriptions/checkout/` - Create Stripe Checkout session
- `/api/subscriptions/status/` - Get subscription status
- `/api/subscriptions/portal/` - Create Customer Portal session
- `/api/subscriptions/config/` - Get Stripe publishable key
- `/stripe/webhook/{uuid}/` - Webhook endpoint (dj-stripe)

### Database Models

**dj-stripe Models (Auto-synced from Stripe):**
- `Customer` - Stripe customers (linked to User via `subscriber` field)
- `Subscription` - Subscription records
- `Product` - Products from Stripe Dashboard
- `Price` - Pricing information
- `PaymentMethod` - Payment methods
- `Invoice` - Invoice records
- `Event` - Webhook event log
- `WebhookEndpoint` - Webhook configurations

**Custom Models:**
- `TrialUsageTracking` - Tracks if user has used trial period

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Test Mode vs Production Mode

**Controlled by:** `STRIPE_LIVE_MODE` environment variable

**Test Mode** (`STRIPE_LIVE_MODE=false`):
- Uses test API keys: `sk_test_...`, `pk_test_...`
- Processes test payments (card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
- Safe for development and testing
- No real money processed

**Production Mode** (`STRIPE_LIVE_MODE=true`):
- Uses live API keys: `sk_live_...`, `pk_live_...`
- Processes real payments
- Real money charged to customers
- Requires full compliance setup

### 2. Webhook Architecture

**Why Webhooks Are Critical:**
- Stripe events happen outside your application (payment succeeded, subscription canceled)
- Webhooks notify your application of these events
- Without webhooks, subscription status becomes stale

**Webhook Flow:**
```
1. Event occurs in Stripe (e.g., payment succeeds)
2. Stripe sends POST request to your webhook URL
3. dj-stripe verifies webhook signature
4. Event is saved to Event model
5. Corresponding signal is triggered
6. Your signal handlers process the event
7. Database is updated with new status
```

**Critical Webhook Events:**
- `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription created
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription status changed
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription canceled
- `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` - Trial ending soon (3 days)
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Payment successful
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Payment failed

### 3. Trial Eligibility Logic

**Rules:**
1. User must NOT have `has_used_trial=true` in TrialUsageTracking
2. User must NOT have any past subscriptions (even canceled)
3. Trial period: 7 days
4. Trial is marked as used via webhook `customer.subscription.created`

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Race condition between checkout and webhook (webhook is source of truth)
- User cancels trial and tries to get another (prevented by TrialUsageTracking)
- User with canceled paid subscription tries trial (prevented by past subscription check)

### 4. Customer-User Linking

**Critical Concept:** Stripe Customers must be linked to Django Users

**Link Method:**
```python
customer.subscriber = user  # Django User object
customer.save()
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Middleware checks `customer__subscriber=user` to find subscriptions
- Without link, user appears to have no subscription
- Access is denied even if subscription exists in Stripe

**Verification:**
```python
Customer.objects.filter(subscriber=user).exists()  # Must be True
```

### 5. Subscription Status Flow

```
New User
    ↓
Creates Checkout Session (trial_period_days=7)
    ↓
Completes Payment in Stripe Checkout
    ↓
Stripe Creates Subscription (status='trialing')
    ↓
Webhook: customer.subscription.created
    ↓
dj-stripe Syncs Subscription to Database
    ↓
Signal Handler Marks Trial as Used
    ↓
User Has Access (has_active_subscription=True)
    ↓
7 Days Pass
    ↓
Webhook: customer.subscription.updated (status='trialing' → 'active')
    ↓
First Payment Processed
    ↓
Recurring Billing Monthly
    ↓
[If User Cancels]
    ↓
Webhook: customer.subscription.updated (cancel_at_period_end=True)
    ↓
End of Billing Period
    ↓
Webhook: customer.subscription.deleted
    ↓
User Loses Access (has_active_subscription=False)
```

- Can be automated with alerts

**Total Time for First Deployment:** 3-4 hours
**Total Time for Subsequent Deployments:** 1-2 hours (using QUICKSTART)

---

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

1. **Webhook Test Passes**
   - Stripe Dashboard shows 200 OK for test webhook
   - Event appears in database
   - Signal handler processes event

2. **End-to-End Checkout Works**
   - User can complete checkout
   - Trial is applied (if eligible)
   - Subscription created in database
   - Customer linked to User
   - Trial marked as used

3. **Access Control Functions**
   - Subscribed users can access protected endpoints
   - Non-subscribed users receive 402 error
   - Exempt paths remain accessible

4. **Customer Portal Works**
   - Portal session creates successfully
   - User can manage subscription
   - Changes sync back to database

5. **Subscription Status Accurate**
   - Status endpoint returns correct data
   - Database matches Stripe Dashboard
   - Webhook events process correctly

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to run migrations**
   - Always run `python manage.py migrate djstripe`
   - Verify with `python manage.py showmigrations`

2. **Using wrong API keys**
   - Test keys in production (or vice versa)
   - Verify with `STRIPE_LIVE_MODE` setting

3. **Skipping initial data sync**
   - Webhooks won't work if Products/Prices aren't synced
   - Always run `python manage.py sync_stripe`

4. **Not setting webhook secret**
   - Webhooks will fail with 401
   - Must set `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and redeploy

5. **Forgetting to link Customers to Users**
   - Run `python manage.py fix_customer_links` after sync
   - Verify with subscription status checks

6. **Not monitoring webhooks**
   - Check Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks > Recent deliveries
   - Failed webhooks mean stale data

7. **Using wrong webhook URL format**
   - Must use dj-stripe format: `/stripe/webhook/{uuid}/`
   - Don't manually create URLs, sync from Stripe

8. **Not testing trial eligibility**
   - Verify both new and returning users
   - Check TrialUsageTracking is working

## Final Notes

**This is a production-ready system** that has been carefully architected with:
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Security best practices (webhook signature verification)
- Database deadlock prevention
- Race condition mitigation
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

**The deployment is reversible:**
- Set `STRIPE_LIVE_MODE=false` to rollback
- Database data is preserved
- No destructive operations by default

**The system is maintainable:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented code
- Django management commands for common tasks
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

**Your user was correct:** This is much more than just changing environment variables. This deployment requires careful orchestration of:
1. Database schema changes
2. Data synchronization
3. Webhook configuration
4. Security setup
5. Access control
6. Testing and verification

Follow the guides in order, verify each step, and you'll have a robust production subscription system.

Good luck with your deployment!
