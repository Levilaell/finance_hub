## Testing Architecture

### Test Types Required
1. **Unit Tests**: Model validation, business logic, utility functions
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, cross-app functionality
3. **System Tests**: End-to-end workflows, user journeys
4. **Performance Tests**: Database queries, API response times
5. **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, data isolation

### Test Tools & Framework
- **Django Test Framework**: Built-in testing capabilities
- **DRF Test Client**: API endpoint testing
- **Factory Boy**: Test data generation
- **Coverage.py**: Test coverage reporting
- **Mock/Patch**: External service mocking

### Test Execution Requirements
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All tests MUST be executed after creation to ensure they are functional.

**Test Execution Protocol:**
1. **After writing each test file**: Run `python manage.py test apps.<app>.tests.<test_file> --failfast -v 2`
2. **After completing an app**: Run `python manage.py test apps.<app> --failfast -v 1`
3. **Fix any failing tests immediately** - Do not proceed until all tests pass
4. **Verify test isolation** - Tests should not depend on each other or external state
5. **Check test data cleanup** - Each test should start with a clean database state

**Common Issues to Check:**
- User creation with correct required fields (username, email, first_name, last_name)
- Proper mocking of external services (PaymentService, EmailService, etc.)
- Correct URL patterns matching the actual URL configuration
- Proper authentication setup for API tests
- Model field validation and constraints
