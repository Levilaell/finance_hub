# CRITICAL JWT AUTHENTICATION FIX

## Root Cause Discovered
Railway production environment had RSA keys configured in environment variables:
- JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_B64 (RSA key)
- JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_B64 (RSA key)

This caused the system to attempt RS256 authentication while our code was simplified to HS256, creating a mismatch.

## Solution Applied
1. **Forced HS256 in production.py** - Override any environment RSA keys
2. **Explicit SIMPLE_JWT configuration** - Ignore base.py settings 
3. **Bearer token only** - No cookie authentication

## Expected Result
- Authentication should work with Bearer tokens
- No more InvalidToken exceptions
- Login functionality restored

## Validation
Run `python force_hs256_production.py` to verify configuration.
