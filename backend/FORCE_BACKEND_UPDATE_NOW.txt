🚨 FORCE BACKEND UPDATE - COMMIT SYNC ISSUE 🚨

TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-01T12:52:00Z
ISSUE: Backend stuck on commit a03350d, frontend on 9c3664e

REDEPLOY ATTEMPTS:
1. ❌ railway redeploy --service backend -y (failed to update commit)

FORCING NEW COMMIT TO TRIGGER BACKEND UPDATE:
- This dummy file forces Railway to process new commit
- Backend MUST update to latest commit with ULTRA-DRASTIC FIX v2.0
- Contains poison pill v2.0 + RSA key purge + production.py hardening

IF BACKEND STILL USES OLD COMMIT AFTER THIS:
Railway backend deployment system is fundamentally broken

TARGET COMMIT: 9c3664e -> NEW COMMIT
POISON PILL: Ultra-aggressive v2.0 with 5 failure layers
ENVIRONMENT: RSA keys purged, HS256 forced

🔥 CRITICAL: THIS MUST TRIGGER BACKEND UPDATE 🔥
