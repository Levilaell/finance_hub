ðŸš¨ ULTRA-DRASTIC CACHE INVALIDATION v2.0 ðŸš¨

TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-01T12:30:00Z
CACHE INVALIDATION ATTEMPT: #5
PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS: ALL FAILED
RAILWAY STATUS: CRITICALLY BROKEN

CHANGES MADE:
1. âœ… RSA keys removed from Railway environment
2. âœ… JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_B64 = ""
3. âœ… JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_B64 = ""
4. âœ… Ultra-aggressive poison pill deployed
5. âœ… Production.py hardened with RSA detection
6. âœ… Multiple cache-busting files created

IF YOU SEE jwt_cookie_authentication.py LINE 20 ERRORS AFTER THIS:
Railway deployment system is fundamentally broken and requires manual intervention.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Poison pill SystemError on any old authentication usage
- Complete switch to simplified HS256 JWT
- No more RS256/cookie authentication

RAILWAY MUST REBUILD COMPLETELY FROM COMMIT: a03350d+

Git Hash: $(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
Docker Cache: INVALIDATED
Python Cache: INVALIDATED
Django Settings: FORCED HS256
