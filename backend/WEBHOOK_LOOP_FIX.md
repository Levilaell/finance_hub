# Webhook Infinite Loop Fix

## Problem
Webhooks were creating an infinite loop where:
1. Webhook receives "item/updated" event
2. Handler syncs transactions and triggers item update
3. Item update triggers new "item/updated" webhook
4. Process repeats indefinitely

## Solution
Modified webhook handlers to NOT trigger item updates when processing webhook events.

## Changes Made

### 1. webhooks.py - Line 119
```python
# Don't trigger update from webhook since it's already updated
tx_service.sync_all_accounts_transactions(connection, trigger_update=False)
```

### 2. webhooks.py - Line 279 (transactions/created)
```python
# Don't trigger update since transactions are already available
tx_service.sync_all_accounts_transactions(connection, trigger_update=False)
```

### 3. webhooks.py - Line 312 (transactions/updated)
```python
# Don't trigger update since transactions are already updated
tx_service.sync_all_accounts_transactions(connection, trigger_update=False)
```

## How It Works

### Manual Sync Flow
1. User triggers manual sync via API
2. System triggers item update in Pluggy
3. Pluggy sends webhook when update completes
4. Webhook handler syncs data WITHOUT triggering another update

### Webhook Flow
1. Pluggy sends webhook (item/updated, transactions/created, etc.)
2. Handler syncs accounts and transactions
3. NO item update triggered (trigger_update=False)
4. No additional webhooks generated

## Results
- ✅ R$ 0.15 transaction now appears correctly
- ✅ No more infinite webhook loops
- ✅ Manual sync works properly
- ✅ Webhook sync works properly

## Key Insight
Webhooks indicate that data is ALREADY updated in Pluggy, so there's no need to trigger another update. The update should only be triggered for:
1. Manual sync requests from users
2. Scheduled sync jobs
3. NOT from webhook handlers
